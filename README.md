HBSimulations
=============
Hair-bundle simulations and their associated functions, written in MATLAB, are included here. Certain functions, such as HBModel, simulate an artificial hair bundle. Others create models based on the limit-cycle behavior of oscillatory hair bundles.

Comments for new files are in the Commit headers and all MATLAB files include comments with appropriate descriptions.
